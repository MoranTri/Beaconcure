Hello,

My name is <ins>Moran Treibochan</ins>.

In order to show my automations skills, I build mini automation test with 3 automatic scenarios:

<ins>**Test 1**</ins> - Verifying successful entrance to beaconcure site by locating the main page header.

<ins>**Test 2**</ins> - Navigate to faq page and displaying all the questions and their answers.

<ins>**Test 3**</ins> - Navigate to contact us page and fill the form fields with details stored in my DB.
 
For this mini automation project I built the infrastructure from scratch, using java, page-objects model, and additional tools such as: Maven, TestNG, Selenium, mySQL and Allure-Report.
Used version control system (git) to upload all the code to github.

The <ins>src/main/java</ins> directory contains all the infrastructure files and methods and the <ins>src/test/java</ins> directory contains the test scenarios.
