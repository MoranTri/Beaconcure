Hello,

My name is <ins>Moran Treibochan</ins>.

In order to show my automations skills, I build mini automation test with 3 automatic scenarios:

<ins>**Test 1**</ins> - Check if the search box is working and returning correct results.

<ins>**Test 2**</ins> - Check if by click the food type from the side list, returns correct results.

<ins>**Test 3**</ins> - Check if by entering an address (getting from DB using query), the return results match the entered address.
 
For this mini automation project I built the infrastructure from scratch, using java, page-objects model and additional tools such as: Maven, TestNG, Selenium, mySQL and Allure-Report.
Used version control system (git) to upload all the code to github.

The <ins>src/main/java</ins> directory contains all the infrastructure files and methods and the <ins>src/test/java</ins> directory contains the test scenarios.
