Hello,

My name is Moran Treibochan.

In order to show my automations skills, I build mini automation test with 3 automatic scenarios:

**Test 1** - Check if the search box is working and returning correct results.

**Test 2** - Check if by click the food type from the side list, returns correct results.

**Test 3** - Check if by entering an address (getting from DB using query), the return results match the entered address.
 
For this mini automation test I build the infrastructure from scratch, using: Maven, TestNG, selenium, mySQL and allure report.
uploaded all the code to github.
